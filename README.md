# A Data-Based Understanding of Political Revolutions
Political upheavals have been ever present throughout humanity. Political leaders shape the context for everything we know. For that reason, we as a society need to generate a concrete understanding of when a revolution or political change is imminent. This analysis seeks to forecast whether a given protest will lead to a revolution within 90 days. 

The stakeholders for this analysis are wide reaching, but it is most relevant to political organizers and leadership. They can use this approach to best understand where efforts are best focused and most likely to lead to an impact. 

We as a society have only begun to establish the collection of data necessary to make these analyses feasible, but we have crossed the threshold of significance beyond which there is substantial merit in this project.
