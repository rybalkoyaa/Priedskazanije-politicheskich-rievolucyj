*About the Mass Mobilization Project
The Mass Mobilization (MM) data are an effort to understand citizen movements against governments, what citizens want when they demonstrate against governments, and how governments respond to citizens. The MM data cover 162 countries between 1990 and 2018.

These data contain events where 50 or more protesters publicly demonstrate against government, resulting in more than 10,000 protest events. Each event records location, protest size, protester demands, and government responses.

For each event, the MM data itemize what protesters demand across as many as seven categories, including labor/wages, land, police brutality, political process, prices/taxes, removal of a politician, and social restrictions. The dataset also records up to seven types of government responses, including accommodation, arrests, beatings, crowd dispersal, ignore, killings, and shootings.

The Mass Mobilization project is sponsored by the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). The PITF is funded by the Central Intelligence Agency. The views expressed herein are the Principal Investigators' alone and do not represent the views of the US Government.*
