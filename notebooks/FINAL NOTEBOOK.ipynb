    "# A Data-Based Understanding of Political Revolutions\n",
    "Political upheavals have been ever present throughout humanity. Political leaders shape the context for everything we know. For that reason, we as a society need to generate a concrete understanding of when a revolution or political change is imminent. This analysis seeks to forecast whether a given protest will lead to a revolution within 90 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders for this analysis are wide reaching, but it is most relevant to political organizers and leadership. They can use this approach to best understand where efforts are best focused and most likely to lead to an impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "We as a society have only begun to establish the collection of data necessary to make these analyses feasible, but we have crossed the threshold of significance beyond which there is substantial merit in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Notes\n",
    "Given the large-scale nature of the project, this notebook inevitably does not contain the entire analysis. It does not go into depth on each of the choices made for feature selection or data cleaning. Consider this the \"top level\" notebook, and those more detail-oriented parts of the analysis are handled in their own spaces. Here is where you should go to find more details:\n",
    "1. **[protests cleaning file name]:** Refer to this notebook for a ground-up analysis of the \"Protests\" dataset. It includes important features such as the nature of each protest (size, objectives, location, etc.) and the associated data selection and cleaning choices. \n",
