      "canada s federal government has agreed to acquire a tract of land that has been the subject of armed dispute between mohawk indians and officials of a montreal suburb, quebec s minister of indian affairs announced today. at a press conference in montreal, the province s indian affairs minister, john ciaccia, said federal officials had approved the purchase or expropriation if necessary of 55 acres of woodland that mohawks of the kahnesatake community claim as ancestral land. the suburban town of oka, 18 miles west of montreal, planned to use it for an addition to a golf course. ciaccia did not say the land would be recognized as mohawk ancestral territory, but it was clear from his description that the federal action would be intended to block the golf course extension that the indians have been fighting. during the last week and a half of the four month golf course dispute, about 200 mohawks, armed with automatic assault rifles and other weapons, have faced off against hundreds of quebec provincial police. a police officer was shot to death on july 11 when the police tried to remove a barricade erected on the disputed land. it is not clear whether the officer was shot by fellow police or armed indians. \n",
