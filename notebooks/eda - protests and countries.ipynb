      "a truckers strike that has thrown brazil into chaos entered its sixth day on saturday, with protesters blocking traffic on hundreds of highways, supermarkets rationing fruit and gas station pumps running dry. s o paulo, brazil s financial center and home to 12 million people, declared a state of emergency on friday. by saturday, 11 airports around the country had run out of fuel. uber drivers joined the strike and blocked trucks from exiting an oil refinery in northern brazil. the government urged brazilians to limit their water consumption as uncertainty grew over how long the strike would last. president michel temer ordered the military to break up the strike, and the government said late friday that 45 percent of barriers on the highways had been removed. but the truckers union said it still wouldn t deliver any goods. a 50 percent rise in fuel prices over the past year sparked the strike. truckers are demanding lower gas prices, as well as reductions in taxes and tolls. yet a weeklong standoff between striking truck drivers and the government has provided a stark counternarrative, illustrating the shaky recovery of brazil s economy, latin america s largest, and the widespread disdain brazilians have toward their ruling class. hundreds of trucker roadblocks sealed off highways across the country as a protest against rising fuel prices ground brazil s economy to a halt in recent days. gas stations from s o paulo, the financial capital, to manaus, in the heart of the amazon, have run out of fuel. dozens of flights have been canceled, fresh food supplies in supermarkets have dwindled and millions of chickens and pigs have been culled because of a lack of animal feed. on monday, many schools and universities suspended classes. over the weekend, mr. temer issued an order authorizing the military to clear roads using force, if necessary, a move that drew condemnation from human rights groups. but after that threat failed to bring the strike to an end, mr. temer appeared weary as he announced in a televised statement on sunday that the government would subsidize the cost of diesel to drop the price at the pump by 12 percent. he also said truck drivers would pay less in tolls and get more government contracts. the measures were striking concessions by a government that has sought to rein in spending as brazil emerges from a long, crippling recession. on monday morning, roughly one hundred protesters gathered at an oil refinery on the outskirts of rio de janeiro, which has been one of the focal points of the strike. truckers were a minority at the demonstration. but scores of unemployed oil workers, motorcycle couriers and public transportation workers said they wanted their grievances addressed as well. president michel temer has announced 2.5 billion worth of concessions to truck drivers who have blocked brazil s highways and kept goods from reaching supermarkets, stores and gas stations for a week. the announcement late sunday marked temer s third attempt at resolving a dispute over fuel prices that has taken latin america s largest economy hostage. initially, he took a tough stance on the strike and called on the military to intervene, but he then walked back his statements several times as gas pumps ran dry and produce prices soared. in a televised speech, temer appealed to the drivers sense of responsibility, solidarity and patriotism. he said he would force gas stations to cut the price of diesel by 12 cents a liter, freeze that price for two months and cut tolls for truckers riding with no cargo. \n",

      "president uhuru kenyatta on friday was officially declared the winner of a bitterly disputed election in kenya, but his opponent, raila odinga, refused to concede defeat, criticizing the vote as a charade and edging the country closer to violence. on friday, mr. odinga s party, the national super alliance, refused to take part in the announcement of the election results, accusing the commission of releasing the outcome before addressing its concerns. top opposition party officials also indicated that they were unwilling to resolve their claims about election fraud in court, in comments that could be interpreted by supporters as a call to protest. protests in several opposition strongholds erupted shortly after mr. kenyatta s victory was declared. police officers equipped with riot gear moved into some areas of nairobi, the capital, and kisumu, kenya s third largest city and mr. odinga s birthplace, where tear gas was used and live bullets were fired at protesters, according to witnesses. the sun had barely risen, but protesters were already bracing for another wave of confrontations with the police in the city of kisumu on saturday after an election disputed by supporters of kenya s opposition party. as the smell of tear gas and smoke from burning debris clung to the morning mist, residents began assessing the damage from the previous night s protests after the re election of president uhuru kenyatta, a vote that many in this part of western kenya believe was stolen, even though international observers concluded that it was fair and transparent. hundreds of residents of kisumu, an opposition stronghold, clashed overnight with the police, who, they said, cut off electricity to create confusion, sprayed live bullets into crowds, fired tear gas and blasted them with water cannons. the police, witnesses said, conducted house to house raids in parts of the city, and residents accused some officers of beating them with clubs and stealing money from them. the police in kisumu declined to comment on the allegations. at least 24 people, including a 6 year old child, have been killed since the election results were announced friday night, according to the kenyan national commission on human rights. in kibera, nairobi s largest slum, residents said that at least six people were killed late friday and early saturday in clashes with police. young men in the slum had promised for days to hold demonstrations if kenyatta defeated their candidate, raila odinga, who has not yet accepted the results or conceded, raising concerns of further violence. there were also protests in western nyanza province. in a historic ruling and a first in africa, kenya s supreme court nullified on friday september 1st the re election of a sitting president, ordering a new vote to be held within 60 days after finding that the outcome last month had been tainted by irregularities. note: the number of protesters was not included in the sources, and is based on prior coding decisions \n",

of the president s staunchest allies and will now head the military council. kamal abdel marouf al mahi, the sudanese military s chief of staff, will be its deputy head. the toppling of mr bashir, 75, known as the butcher of darfur after atrocities in the western region, came after months of protests that culminated in a sit in by thousands of people outside the army headquarters in the capital, khartoum. yesterday they vowed to defy the imposition of a night curfew and continue their action until a civilian body controlled the transition. the risk of instability is significant, with various factions within the security apparatus potentially siding with the demonstrators or staying loyal to mr bashir, who ruled for 30 years. the deposed leader had deliberately set up labyrinthine parallel structures to prevent the military taking control. last night columns of demonstrators filled khartoum s roads and bridges over the nile as they marched towards the protest camp where they were determined to spend a sixth night. more demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country, including in the eastern city of atbara, where the first protest was held four months ago. fall, again! many chanted in khartoum, varying the anti bashir fall, that s all! refrain that marked the uprising s initial demands. awad abdel bayen, a leading opposition figure, described the takeover as giving new life to bashir rule . the sudanese professionals association, the biggest protest group, announced that the revolution continues . sudan s powerful intelligence chief stepped down on saturday, two days after the president was ousted, as huge crowds of demonstrators remained encamped outside the country s military headquarters. those demonstrators, who in the past week have numbered in the hundreds of thousands, have proved the most potent force for democratic change to sweep through sudan in more than three decades. in response to their demands over the past week, sudan s armed forces deposed president omar hassan al bashir, the autocrat who had ruled the country since 1989. that was midday thursday. but the junta that took power and announced that it intended to rule for the next two years quickly discovered that the demonstrators weren t going home. by friday night, the general who appeared to be in charge of the junta announced that he was stepping down. the move was seen as intended to assuage the demonstrators, who viewed him as not very different from the ousted president a point their protest chant made clear: we do not replace a thief with a thief. and saturday, the state news agency announced the resignation of the intelligence chief, salah abdallah gosh, a notorious and feared figure in sudan s security establishment who was widely considered the second most powerful figure after mr. al bashir. in a sense, mr. gosh s departure was another victory for the protesters, many of whom have been calling for his agency, the national intelligence and security service, to be dismantled. but it was not clear whether the protesters anger at the intelligence service had led to mr. gosh s resignation, or whether rival security chiefs and military generals in sudan s fractured security establishment had ousted him in a power struggle. demonstrators cheered into the night at the toppling of a second reviled bashir regime leader in less than 48 hours. their numbers swelled on the seventh night of demonstrations in front of the army headquarters in the capital, khartoum, and in defiance of a curfew. protest leaders hailed the announcement that the general was stepping down as a victory of people s will . we now want to witness the power being handed over to the civilians, this is the ... democracy and freedom we aimed to achieve, abdul jabar ibrahim, 60, said. general ibn auf, whose deputy, kamal abdel marouf al mahi, also quit, named his successor as abdel fattah abdelrahman burhan, a general but a less islamist figurehead and one the military hopes will be accepted. he was expected to address the nation today. sara abdelgalil, from the sudanese professionals association, the main protest group, hailed the resignations as two great victories , and said that the momentum of the revolution should be augmented . demonstrators near sudan s military headquarters in khartoum on sunday, april 14. sudan s new ruling military council announced on sunday that it would name a civilian prime minister and cabinet, but not a president, to help govern the country after the coup that removed the longtime leader omar hassan al bashir. an army spokesman, lt. gen. shamseldin kibashi, also said in televised remarks that the military had begun to overhaul security organizations and would allow demonstrations to continue outside the military headquarters in khartoum, the capital. the announcement was unlikely to satisfy protesters, though, who have demanded full civilian rule. organizers have urged the military to immediately and unconditionally hand power to a transitional civilian government. the sudanese professionals association, which has spearheaded the protests, posted a nine point list of demands on sunday, including prosecution of those behind an islamist backed military coup in 1989, a freeze on the assets of leading officials in mr. al bashir s government and dismissal of top judges and prosecutors. the sit in that began more than a week ago has spawned a mini state in sudan s capital, run entirely by young sudanese men and women working as equals for a single cause. the movement started four months ago in anger over bread prices and came to a climax last week when it toppled president bashir, the despot who had ruled for 30 years. within hours his immediate interim successor had also been ousted. in a microcosm of our society, committees have been set up to deliver every service that demonstrators might need. for medical care, there is a free clinic, pharmacy and blood donor trucks. a steady supply of food and water arrives from volunteers homes in sudan hospitality is everything. temporary barber shops have sprung up, cleaners work in shifts round the clock and tea ladies hand out free www.drinks.no one even need worry about missing the football after a donor sent in a huge screen. last week rows of fans cheered the champions league match between barcelona and manchester united. the protest site is the only fully functioning area of khartoum since the mass sit in began on april 6. the leaders of sudan s uprising have threatened to escalate protests that toppled omar al bashir unless the council of generals that took power in his place is disbanded and replaced by civilian rulers. protesters piled on the pressure with a long list of demands after successfully blocking a fresh attempt to break up their mass sit in outside the defence ministry in the capital, khartoum, which began ten days ago and proved the tipping point that ended bashir s 30 years of brutal rule. speaking for the first time since the removal of bashir, 75, last thursday, representatives of the sudanese professionals association spa said they would not co operate with the ruling council unless their demands were met. we will continue the mass escalation and the sit ins to fulfil our demands, said ahmed al rabie, from the spa. the latest concession from the military ruling council, for protesters to name their preferred interim prime minister and cabinet, was insufficient while bashir era appointees had power, protest leaders said. tens of thousands of youthful protesters remain camped outside the military s headquarters, refusing to leave until the military grants their demand for a swift transition to civilian rule. until now, the sit in has been an exuberant, peaceful affair, drawing vast crowds of young sudanese who sing, dance, deliver speeches and flirt, visibly relieved that mr. al bashir s gloomy, repressive rule is over. but talks about the country s future between the military and the protest leaders, led by the sudan professionals association, collapsed this weekend, and tensions are rising. on sunday night, april 21st, tens of thousands of people gathered for one of the largest demonstrations yet, holding their cellphones aloft to create a sea of pinpoint lights. protesters sat over the edge of a railway bridge, banging stones in unison to emphasize their chants. some decried lt. gen. abdel fattah al burhan, the country s interim leader, as filthy. on monday, april 22nd, general al burhan called on the protesters to abandon the checkpoints that ring the sit in area, where volunteers in yellow vests politely search protesters for weapons. security, he noted pointedly, is the military s responsibility. amid the chants praising the revolution of the people, a new slogan appeared this week at a massive sit in protest in sudan s capital: we do not want saudi aid even if we have to eat beans and falafel! the chant underscored the suspicion in the protest camp about the motives of saudi arabia and its close ally, the united arab emirates, after they jointly pledged 3 billion in aid to sudan s transitional military government, which deposed sudanese president omar hassan al bashir this month after 30 years in power. many within the protests fear that the powerful monarchies in saudi arabia and the uae are using their immense wealth to suppress democracy and support a counterrevolution, as they have been accused of doing elsewhere in the region. talks between sudan s protesters, led by the sudanese professionals association, and the military, resumed on wednesday, april 24 after stalling briefly. bankers and senior judges have joined the sit in, strengthening the hand of the protesters. thousands are still camped out at the gates of sudan s military headquarters, demanding a transition to full civilian rule. outside the military headquarters in khartoum, where thousands are demanding a swift transition to civilian rule, darfuris stand defiantly at the gates of the military that persecuted them for years. some hold banners with graphic photos that depict the atrocities they say were visited on their community: piled corpses, torched villages, rape victims sitting mutely. thousands of protesters demanding an immediate transition to civilian rule have been camped at the gates of the military headquarters since mr. al bashir, who ruled sudan for 30 years, was toppled on april 11. generals and protest leaders in sudan have met to try and agree a final deal that would bring an end to decades of brutal military rule. the generals who ousted president bashir last month appeared close to bowing to international demands to make way for civilian rule and prevent a descent into bloodshed and political chaos. the two sides have agreed on transitional structures that will lead sudan to elections in three years, but the thorniest issue of who will hold overall power is still to be settled. demonstrators have sworn to maintain a mass sit in that has gridlocked the streets of the capital, khartoum, for weeks unless the generals agree that civilians should be given the majority of seats on a new sovereign ruling council. crucial negotiations were due to begin may 15th. general yasser al atta, from the ruling council, said: we vow to our people that the agreement will be completed fully within 24 hours in a way that it meets the people s aspirations. on tuesday may 21st, protest leaders called for a general strike after talks with military leaders on a proposed transitional government collapsed. divisions are appearing both within the protest camp and the military leadership, and the feeling of hope that blossomed after bashir s ouster has given way to frustration, a sign that sudan s revolutionary honeymoon may be coming to an end. sudan s security forces stormed a major protest camp in the nation s capital of khartoum on monday, june 3rd, killing an estimated 31 people and wounding hundreds, protest organizers said, in a day of violence that plunged the country s once hopeful revolution into chaos and uncertainty. the dawn raids, led by a paramilitary unit notorious for atrocities in the western region of darfur, appeared to signal that the military was intent on breaking the pro democracy movement that galvanized sudan following the ouster in april of the longtime dictator and president omar hassan al bashir. soldiers fanned out across the city from first light, opening fire on protesters, burning their tents and thrashing civilians with sticks. the brutal crackdown came days after the collapse of power sharing negotiations between civilian and military leaders over who should run sudan during a planned transitional period. on monday that transition was cast into doubt as sudan lurched toward the kind of bloody authoritarianism that quashed the arab spring in 2011. the crackdown confirmed protesters fears that sudan s military, backed by the wealthy rulers of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, was never serious about its claims to support civilian rule. a day after security forces violently cleared the main protest camp in khartoum, the leaders of sudan s protest movement rejected a plan by the nation s military leaders to hold elections within nine months. the paramilitary group, known as the rapid support forces, or rsf, patrolled khartoum s streets, putting the city on lockdown and setting up dozens of checkpoints. the rsf dismantled the sit in site monday in an attack that killed at least 35, according to sudan doctors syndicate, a professional group associated with the protests. in a statement, the group said that four of the dead were children and that 650 people had been injured. note: the variation in state responses is due to different actions that were undertaken throughout the life of the continuous protest \n",

      "sudan s ruling generals and opposition leaders behind the protests that drove president omar hassan al bashir from power last month said wednesday that they have made significant progress in negotiations and have agreed on the length of the country s transition period. the two sides, which have been at odds over the transfer of power to civilian rule and the extent of the military s role in it, said the transition would last three years. the military ousted bashir on april 11, after nearly four months of mass protests over his 30 year rule. but demonstrators remained on the streets, demanding that the military hand over power to civilian rule and have since been holding negotiations with the military council. activists said clashes flared up wednesday between protesters and paramilitary forces attempting to remove barricades on a main street in khartoum. the opposition sudan doctors committee said wednesday night that at least 14 people were wounded in the clashes, seven of them hurt by gunfire. ahmed rabie, a spokesman for the sudanese professionals association spa , a union umbrella that has spearheaded the protests since december, said the military council suspended the talks late wednesday. he said the council has called for the removal of barricades and the opening of roads in khartoum and elsewhere in the country. the agreement announced on wednesday marks a significant step toward resolving the standoff between the military and the protesters and could help the sudanese return to some sort of normalcy. note: the actual number of national protesters was not included in the sources, and is based on prior coding decisions. \n",

      "tens of thousands of pro democracy protesters filled the streets of sudan s major cities on sunday in a defiant rebuke of the generals whose violent crackdown earlier in the month had left scores of people dead. despite veiled threats of violence from gen. mohamed hamdan, the powerful paramilitary commander who led the june 3 crackdown, protesters paraded down major streets in the capital, khartoum, banging drums and chanting, civilian rule. some converged on the homes of protesters killed in earlier violence. others pushed toward the military headquarters and the presidential palace, which overlooks the nile, only to be repelled by police officers firing tear gas. the central committee of sudan doctors said one man had been shot dead by soldiers in atbara, a city about 200 miles northeast of khartoum where protests first erupted in december over the soaring price of bread. a sudanese official from the ministry of health said sunday night that at least seven people had died and 181 had been injured in the day s demonstrations, the associated press reported. on saturday, general hamdan s troops raided the main office of the sudanese professionals association, which is leading the protest movement, and prevented the group from holding a news conference. at least seven demonstrators were killed and 180 injured when security forces fired tear gas in khartoum and the eastern town of gadaref as tens of thousands of people protested across sudan demanding civilian rule. sudan s military and civilian leaders announced on friday that they had reached an agreement to share power until elections, promising an end to the standoff that has paralyzed the african country since the ouster of president omar hassan al bashir in april. the two sides, which resumed talks this week after a monthlong hiatus that included a bloody crackdown by the military, have agreed to form a joint military civilian authority to run sudan during an interim period of just over three years, a senior protest leader said. power will rotate between military and civilian leaders during the transitional period, a mediator from the african union, mohamed hassan lebatt, told a news conference in khartoum. then, elections are to be held and the military is to return to its barracks, ushering in democratic rule. a military general will lead the joint council for the first 21 months, then a civilian leader will lead for 18 months, said amjad farid, a leader of the sudanese professionals association. \n",

      "prime minister saad hariri of lebanon offered his resignation on tuesday, bowing to a demand of the enormousantigovernment protests that have consumed the country and suspended daily life for nearly two weeks. i m at a dead end, mr. hariri said in a televised speech. jobs come and go, but what s important is the country, he added, echoing the words of his father, rafik hariri, the former prime minister who was assassinated in 2005. no one s bigger than the nation. but there were no signs of softening from the protesters, whose signature chant all of them means all of them encapsulates their fury at the entire political class. they returned to the demonstrations and roadblocks on tuesday after the announcement, despite an attack on protesters earlier in the day that underlined the challenges of breaking up the existing sectarian power structure. with no clear alternative to the current leadership and the economy veering toward collapse, tuesday s events catapulted lebanon only further into political uncertainty. years of barely suppressed rage over lebanon s corruption, dysfunction and widening inequality detonated on oct. 17, when the government, frantic to come up with new revenue to head off the financial crisis, announced a tax on calls made over popular, free internet based messaging services including whatsapp. over the next several days, protests mushroomed from dozens of people into the hundreds of thousands, propelling as much as a quarter of the population of this small mediterranean country including people of all ages and sects into the streets nationwide. banks, schools and some offices have been closed ever since as protesters have seized and blocked major roads, defying attempts by the lebanese army to reopen them. whoever succeeds mr. hariri will be hard pressed to address the protesters ultimate target: lebanon s deadlocked, corrupt political system, under which leaders of the country s 18 officially recognized religious groups divide power and state funds for themselves and their followers at the expense of the country as a whole. the dysfunctional government has been unable to provide consistent services such as 24 hour electricity, tap water or garbage disposal. this is a moment of political awakening for this country, said maha yahya, the director of the beirut based carnegie middle east center. for the first time, people want to bring down the political sectarian system that s been governing them, and this poses an existential crisis for political parties that rely on sectarian identities. the question is, what next? she added. will those that hold the guns go along with this? will they play the sectarian card? we have to wait and see. tuesday afternoon offered an early, foreboding answer, with the attack on protesters in downtown beirut showing the limits of their support. a few hours before mr. hariri spoke, supporters of hezbollah and the amal movement, two powerful shiite muslim political parties, charged peaceful protesters in downtown beirut, beating some of them and destroying tents that demonstrators had set up there. it was unclear what provoked the fight, but the hezbollah leader, hassan nasrallah, had expressed opposition to the government s resignation on friday, dividing some of his followers between personal reverence for him and anger with the government. similarly, amal supporters have rushed to defend their leader, nabih berri, the speaker of parliament, when he has been lumped in with the other leaders accused of corruption. \n",

      "mass protests in the kingdom of jordan have shattered years of consensus and underlying tensions over the weekend. for four days, thousands of jordanians have protested in amman against an income draft law, but also against rising prices and economic problems. anger over the economy has been percolating for years but these protests shed light on rising social concerns as the public is being encouraged to blame prime minister hani mulki. on tuesday, mulki resigned and the king tapped harvard educated economist and education minister omar al razzaz to replace the embattled prime minister. the mass protests are a rare sign of popular dissent in a country that has attempted to remain stable amid regional turmoil. by replacing mulki, king abdullah hopes to stem the protests. razzaz worked at the world bank previously and his background should provide confidence. the jordan times editorial on monday said protesters took to the street in a civilized democratic manner to express their rejection of the government measures and to demand that their voices be heard. the editorial went on to note that people are angry over officials receiving luxury cars and high salaries while people shoulder a heavy burden with a weak economy. they get to travel to unneeded conferences and they get per diems for doing so, they send their children to expensive private schools, rather than poorly equipped government schools. this is strong and unusual criticism. the parliament also recommended that abdullah convene parliament for an extraordinary session. the spark for the protests was an income tax draft law that would have increased taxes on employees by 5 and on companies as well. it was part of a group of reforms proposed as part of a 723 million credit line from the international monetary fund. the protests come after years of concerns in jordan about security and the rising cost the kingdom has faced in dealing with almost a million refugees from syria. even before the recent issues, there were protests in 2012 when the government cut fuel cost subsidies. since then tourism in the kingdom has nosedived and the country faces other struggles. on june 1, the king froze fuel and electricity price hikes that were supposed to start last friday. according to reports, 33 associations and unions have taken part in the protests. hashtags on social media have driven the protests as well. one is called the fourth strike and fourth circle referring to the location of the strike. protesters have appeared in the capital, the northern city of irbid, jarash, zarqa and elsewhere. the reversal last week of a deeply unpopular tax law appeared to defuse days of mass protests in the jordanian capital, amman, but out in the provinces, rami fawri was not impressed. are we supposed to clap? asked fawri, a 40 year old owner of a stationery shop in salt, a hilltop city west of amman. they want me to forget what they did to me before? no, i remember. i remember the prices went up. we are suffocating. \n",

      "hundreds of thousands of pro democracy protesters returned to the streets of hong kong on sunday, defying a ban on assembly before being violently dispersed by police tear gas and a water cannon. a police water cannon filled with stinging blue dye blasted protesters along a major thoroughfare in kowloon. it also hit a small group standing guard outside a mosque an important spiritual nexus for the city s largely south asian muslim community leaving bystanders choking and vomiting. protesters vandalized businesses viewed as supporting beijing, threw molotov cocktails at police stations, set barricades on fire and smashed up subway stations in chaotic scenes that have become familiar to the city after five months of sustained protest. the huge turnout, estimated by organizers at around 350,000 and including families, children and the elderly, showed that the movement maintains widespread support in the face of the increasingly violent tactics of protesters and the escalating use of force by police. marchers made a sea of colored umbrellas through the narrow streets of the city s kowloon area, which are lined with malls and international hotels. some waved catalonian flags in solidarity with the independence protests in that region of spain. in contrast to previous demonstrations, tensions escalated quickly, with clashes erupting long before sunset. by late afternoon, protesters were throwing molotov cocktails and bricks at police stations. in a show of their increasing sophistication, protesters also produced power tools to drill metal railings into road surfaces for sturdier barricades to hold back police. \n",

      "residents continued their protests against the deployment of a terminal high altitude area defense thaad over the weekend in regions considered as possible sites for the u.s. missile defense system. the protests came after seoul and washington agreed friday july 8 to deploy the advanced defense system on south korean soil in an effort to deter north korean ballistic missile threats. in front of waegwan train station in chilgok county, saturday july 9, 3,000 residents gathered to protest against a thaad installation in the region. waegwan seems to be one of the strongest candidates because of its small population and an existing u.s. military base. villagers rallied under a sweltering sun to condemn the choice of their county, seongju, which is about 135 miles southeast of seoul, the capital, for the so called terminal high altitude area defense system, known as thaad. south korea and the united states say the powerful missile and radar system is needed to defend the country, and american forces stationed here, against north korean missiles, but residents fear it will threaten their health and ruin their agricultural economy. we oppose thaad with our lives! the residents chanted, holding banners that bore the same slogan. local political leaders, wearing red headbands, wrote the same vow in blood after cutting their fingers, a dramatic form of protest that has a long history in south korea. some of the politicians and protest leaders also began a hunger strike. prime minister hwang kyo ahn is set to visit the southern town of seongju, which was tapped as the site for the deployment of an advanced u.s. missile defense system, on friday july 8. the trip is seen as a move to alleviate concerns residents may have about health issues related to the missile system s powerful radar and questions raised about the fairness of the government s decision making process. residents of the town, located 296 kilometers south of seoul, started staging protests earlier this week after the government announced it would deploy the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense thaad there. south korea s prime minister was pelted with eggs and water bottles by angry villagers on friday july 15 as he paid a visit to the rural county chosen as the site of a planned united states missile defense system. the visit by prime minister hwang kyo ahn to seongju, about 135 miles southeast of seoul, the capital, was meant to defuse continuing opposition to the missile range. instead, he was forced to retreat as thousands of residents who had gathered in front of seongju s government headquarters shouted, go away! according to television footage. facing the crowd, mr. hwang said south korea needed the terminal high altitude area defense system, or thaad, to defend against north korean missiles. he also apologized for not having explained the rationale for the deployment before the county, which has a population of about 50,000, was named as the site for the missile base on wednesday. residents of the southern town of seongju staged a rally in downtown seoul, july 21st, to protest against the government s decision to deploy an advanced u.s. missile defense system in their county. around 2,000 residents gathered in the capital city to express their concerns about the deployment of the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system. the protesters also wore distinct blue ribbons amid concerns that anti government activists who are not residents of seongju would join the related rallies to instigate illegal violent protests. ruling saenuri party officials visited the southeastern town of seongju on tuesday, in a bid to find solutions to the on going protests by residents who have opposed the deployment of an advanced u.s. missile defense system there. saenuri aims to facilitate dialogue between the government and the residents to persuade the residents of seongju, said chung jin suk, the party s floor leader. defense minister han min koo visited seongju county in north gyeongsang province, wednesday august 17, to talk with local residents on the deployment of an u.s. anti missile system there. this is his second visit to the county since july 13 when seoul and washington announced that a terminal high altitude area defense thaad battery will be placed there in seongsan ri, currently home to a south korean air force air defense unit, by the end of next year. wednesday s visit comes amid growing rumors that the location for thaad could be moved from seongsan ri to a country club owned by lotte group and its surrounding area as a means to calm the angers and fears of residents over the deployment. han said during the meeting with members of a local protest committee that the ministry will consider an alternative location for the battery, if the county recommends a better site. during the visit, han faced about 500 protesters who were holding placards reading we are positively against thaad in front of the seongju county office where the meeting between the minister and the protest committee took place. the committee was formed after the government s deployment announcement. some 60 residents from gimcheon county also came to protest as the lotte skyhill country club located in seongju s chojeon township is close to gimcheon. riot police were deployed to the county office to prevent possible violence. the government sincerely apologizes for having not provided residents with enough explanation ahead of the deployment announcement, han said. \n",

park geun hye, come out and surrender! protesters chanted, their voices reverberating through the center of the capital. the main boulevard that faces the presidential offices and residence, known as the blue house, shimmered with light from candles held by the protesters. police buses formed a barricade to block protesters from getting too close to the presidential compound. the police estimated the crowd on saturday at 260,000, while organizers said as many as one million people had turned out. the largest rally in seoul against scandal plagued president park geun hye that started saturday evening with nearly one million protesters ended early sunday after fierce clashes with police. more than 23 protesters were taken into custody and dozens of other protesters and riot police officers were injured. none of the injured is in a life threatening condition, according to police. the demonstration, the largest in three decades, started on saturday at 4 p.m. as a candlelit vigil and continued throughout the night. under a court ruling that allowed protesters to reach about one kilometer from the presidential office, cheong wa dae, an estimated 8,000 protesters marched along a narrow road leading to the presidential office chanting park geyn hye resign. heavily armed riot police erected a high barricade at the limit line to prevent any further advance. some protesters tried to climb the barricade. the confrontation, which often turned violent, continued until 2:30 a.m. about 1,000 protesters staged a sit in on the road until 4 a.m. and police forcefully dispersed them at 4:15 a.m. president park geun hye will be questioned by the prosecution this week over her role in the influence peddling scandal involving her confidant choi soon sil, prosecutors said sunday. previously, many experts said investigators are most likely to send park a questionnaire; or at most question her in her office. however, following massive protests held against not only the president but also the prosecution, investigators face growing pressure to do away with any special treatment for park in their investigation. on saturday november 19, police said, about 170,000 people turned out for an anti park protest near seoul s city hall. some also marched near the presidential offices. hundreds of thousands of south koreans filled central seoul on saturday november 26 to demand president park geun hye s resignation, in what appeared to be the largest turnout yet in a series of weekly protests against the embattled leader. the police estimate of the turnout was 260,000. it was the fifth consecutive saturday marked by a large protest against the president. the ninth consecutive anti park geun hye protest, saturday december 24, was again a peaceful gathering of the young, old, women and men taking to the streets. in the 13th candlelit protest, hundreds of thousands of protesters also demanded the constitutional court speed up reviewing president park s impeachment. the court has 180 days to decide park s fate. the organizers estimated more than 300,000 proesters in seoul. students hold signs that read arrest park geun hye and no spring without park geun hye s impeachment at dongguk university in seoul, thursday march 9, on the eve of a historic constitutional court impeachment ruling on whether to remove or reinstate park as president. \n",

      "new delhi the rape and killing of an 8 year old girl is provoking major political fallout for india s government, with an explosion of outrage reminiscent of the reaction several years ago after a young woman was brutally raped on a bus and later died of her injuries. in the past few days, as protests erupted across the country, two high level officials from the governing party have resigned, the supreme court has stepped in and opposition leaders have tried to push india s prime minister, narendra modi, into a corner. mr. modi issued brief remarks on friday about the rape case and another recent one, but only after opposition leaders spoke out, criticizing his silence. his statement that the country was ashamed about the rapes and that our daughters will definitely get justice hardly doused the growing anger. the girl came from a nomadic muslim community in the state of jammu and kashmir. the police say a group of hindu men lured her into a forest, kidnapped her, drugged her, locked her in a hindu temple, gang raped her and then strangled her. a rape is a rape. this one may be even worse, said deepa narayan, a social scientist who recently published a book on how women are treated in india. the bus rape was a bunch of drunk men looking for a good time who lost all control. this was a very deliberately planned out crime, using the rape of a little girl over days as a political weapon. in january, when the crime occurred, the girl s death barely registered beyond local news reports. but the case roared back to life this week after a mob of lawyers surrounded a courthouse and tried to block police officers from filing charges the police eventually filed the charge sheet at a judge s house . some of the lawyers were aligned with mr. modi s nationalist party, the bharatiya janata party, known as the b.j.p. two b.j.p. ministers in the jammu and kashmir state government who had participated in the protests resigned on friday under widespread criticism, facing accusations of obstructing justice and fanning religious divisions. the supreme court has issued an order to the lawyers involved in the protests to explain why they physically blocked police officials from entering the courthouse. the lawyers have said they were stirred to action by a right wing hindu group that is pushing for the investigation to be taken out of the hands of the state police, which they say has a pro muslim bias, and given to a national crime bureau they say is more neutral. this latest rape case is rapidly becoming another low point between india s hindus and muslims; politicians have often stirred the two communities against each other, with fatal consequences. the victim was muslim, all eight men arrested were hindus and some of the investigators are muslim. on the other side of the gulf, muslims generally distrust the governing party and its hindu nationalist philosophy. ms. narayan, the author, agreed. modi is always a slow reactor, she said. he waits for an issue to go away and when it doesn t and he s in a corner, he speaks up and makes platitudes. she added: i think the b.j.p. will suffer from this. they will pay a price for the impunity they ve unleashed by not treating crimes as crimes but by politicizing them. a lawmaker from india s ruling party was arrested friday in the rape of a teenager, police said, after days of protests by activists accusing authorities of failing to investigate the case and other attacks. over the weekend, hundreds gathered in cities throughout india to protest the child s killing, waving signs and accusing modi s government of not doing enough to protect women. \n",

      "thousands of religious protesters converged on the capital saturday in a growing confrontation with the pakistani government over official attempts to amend a law that requires all political candidates to affirm their belief that muhammad, who lived in the 7th century, was islam s final prophet. more than 95 percent of pakistanis are muslim. the demonstrators were stopped by security forces and shipping containers placed across major roads, halting most traffic in the capital region for much of the day and preventing office workers, students and other commuters from traveling between islamabad and the nearby garrison city of rawalpindi. they remained there as night fell and vowed to stay indefinitely. the crusade to defend the honor of the prophet is being led by a fringe muslim group called the movement in service of the messenger of god. it is widely seen as an attempt to arouse public antipathy to ahmadis, a small religious minority in pakistan whose followers claim to be muslim but who also follow a 19th century prophet. ahmadis were declared non muslim in 1974. the emotional protests, which began two weeks ago and have grown since, are also viewed as a direct challenge to the authority of the federal government, which has been weakened since former prime minister nawaz sharif was ousted by the supreme court. the messenger of god movement, once seen as a purely religious fringe group, has begun running candidates for parliament in the past two months. the protest leaders have demanded that the federal law minister be fired, charging that he was behind an effort to weaken the electoral law affirming the prophet s finality. they declared saturday that they will not leave their protest site at the main entrance to the capital until the minister is punished. pakistani media reports said they also threatened to attack the homes of some government officials. thousands of supporters of a firebrand pakistani cleric, many armed with sticks and iron rods, have blocked a main entrance to islamabad since last week, demanding the resignation of the country s law minister and a strict adherence to blasphemy laws. led by khadim hussain rizvi of the tehreek e labaik pakistan party, at least 3,000 protesters were staging a sit in on one of the main highways leading to the capital. officials say they suspect some of the protesters are carrying more serious weapons, and there is concern the standoff might turn violent. in response, the government has blocked several other roads to stop the protesters from moving to important government buildings. the latest controversy erupted last month, when the government introduced changes to electoral laws. a change in the wording of an oath for lawmakers that dealt with a declaration of prophet muhammad as god s final prophet quickly set off a furor among opposition parties, especially the religious groups. they protested that the change amounted to blasphemy. thousands of pakistani police officers in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets on saturday as they tried to clear out supporters of a firebrand cleric who have paralyzed the pakistani capital for weeks with a protest on a main highway. authorities said at least six protesters were killed and 200 people including dozens of police officers and paramilitary troops were injured as stone throwing crowds fought with police for control of a highway intersection. clashes also broke out in other cities, including lahore and karachi, with officials saying at least 150 protesters have been arrested. as plumes of smoke rose from the site of the highway clashes, officials in islamabad requested the help of the army to control the law and order situation in the capital, according the ministry of interior. the ministry said that the military authorities would determine the number of troops to be deployed. the demonstrations began three weeks ago after the release of a proposed new version of an oath to be taken by lawmakers that omitted mention of the prophet muhammad. the protesters, many of them supporters of the cleric, khadim hussain rizvi, an outspoken islamist, have demanded that the law minister resign for the omission, which they called blasphemy. supporters of mr. rizvi s political party, tehreek e labaik pakistan, have been camped at the faizabad interchange, blocking the main road from the capital, islamabad, to neighboring rawalpindi. they refused to clear the road until the government agreed to remove the law minister, zahid hamid, over the changed oath. as the standoff has escalated, protest leaders have stepped up their demands, and are now calling for the entire cabinet to resign. protests by muslim activists continued for a second day across pakistan on sunday, but most were peaceful and security forces kept a distance from the crowds, averting a repeat of the unrest that gripped cities and towns saturday after police stormed a protest camp blocking a highway to the capital. pakistan s government struck a deal on monday with leaders of a fundamentalist islamist protest movement, saying that the country s law minister would step down in return for an end to demonstrations that had brought violent clashes and paralyzed the pakistani capital for weeks. the embattled law minister, zahid hamid, whom protesters had accused of blasphemy, resigned as part of negotiations overseen by pakistan s military, officials said. note: the exact start date of the protests was not included in the sources, and is based on prior coding decisions. \n",

      "protests by muslim activists continued for a second day across pakistan on sunday, but most were peaceful and security forces kept a distance from the crowds, averting a repeat of the unrest that gripped cities and towns saturday after police stormed a protest camp blocking a highway to the capital. the army, which was called out by civilian officials saturday night to keep order in the capital region as the demonstrations cascaded, reportedly agreed to guard government buildings in the capital but put off any further action. army leaders formally asked the government to clarify the role of troops in the event of further civilian unrest, apparently concerned about losing public support. late sunday, pakistani media reported that top civilian and military officials had met and agreed to seek a negotiated solution to the crisis. the chaos erupted after millions of pakistanis spontaneously took to the streets saturday to protest what they believed was an insult to the prophet muhammad by the government. clashes between demonstrators and security forces in islamabad and other locations left several hundred injured, and at least six civilians were killed. on sunday, mass funerals were held for some of the victims at the highway camp outside the capital. the main protest leader, cleric allama khadim hussain rizvi, told journalists at the site sunday evening that the group would negotiate only if the government removes the federal law minister, zahid hamid. protesters believe hamid was behind plans to change a law requiring all political candidates to swear that muhammad was the final prophet in islam. pakistan s government struck a deal on monday with leaders of a fundamentalist islamist protest movement, saying that the country s law minister would step down in return for an end to demonstrations that had brought violent clashes and paralyzed the pakistani capital for weeks. the embattled law minister, zahid hamid, whom protesters had accused of blasphemy, resigned as part of negotiations overseen by pakistan s military, officials said. \n",

      "police in pakistan are hunting a serial child killer after the rape and murder of an eight year old girl provoked nationwide outrage and rampaging mobs. zainab ansari was last seen leaving her home in the eastern city of kasur to attend a koranic study class last week. her body was found on waste ground on tuesday. she had been tortured, raped and strangled. public anger has spilt on to the streets, with violent protests at the apparent incompetence and slow response of the authorities after the murders began in 2015. at least two people were killed when police fired on protesters in kasur, further enraging crowds at the spreading demonstrations. shehbaz sharif, the chief minister of punjab, sacked the police chief of kasur and offered a reward of 10 million rupees 67,000 for information leading to the killer. protesters attacked the houses of local politicians in kasur yesterday and demonstrations and candlelit vigils were held for zainab in the provincial capital, lahore. pakistan s national commission on human rights claimed that it published a report into widespread child abuse in kasur two years ago but its findings were ignored. the commission said that people who had tried to report crimes against children had themselves been prosecuted under anti terrorism legislation. zainab s gruesome rape and slaying followed several waves of child abductions, murders and sexual abuse that earned this economically struggling city a macabre reputation as pakistan s capital of child sex abuse. but it also triggered an unprecedented national bout of soul searching, outrage and public confessions from victims of sexual abuse. pakistan is a conservative muslim society; child abuse is common but rarely reported, and sex education is too controversial for public schools. rape victims are often charged with adultery and jailed, and tribal councils part of a traditional parallel justice system have sentenced women and girls to be raped as retribution for forbidden dalliances or elopement committed by their male relatives. in most instances, state authorities do not intervene unless the case is especially egregious and attracts news coverage. but zainab s case, which coincided with the metoo phenomenon in the united states, thrust a long verboten topic into the public arena. headlines screamed pakistan s shame! the justiceforzainab hashtag went viral. celebrities sent out tweets revealing childhood secrets of being molested by older men. clerics from competing muslim groups rushed to lead funeral prayers and protests. provincial government officials, facing calls that they resign, fired kasur s police chief and offered a reward of 10 million rupees about 100,000 for information about the culprit. note: the actual number of protesters was not included in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions \n",

      "at first, the killing last month of naqeebullah mehsud an aspiring model shot by the police in karachi who claimed afterward that he was a taliban militant seemed merely the latest in a long series of abuses carried out by the authorities against ethnic pashtuns in pakistan. but mr. mehsud s case has proved different. the 27 year old s killing, in what appears to have been a staged gun battle, has prompted a protest movement led by young pashtuns from the tribal areas in the country s northwest, where they have long been the targets of military operations, internal displacement, ethnic stereotyping and abductions by the security forces. last week, a social media savvy group of young pashtuns organized a sit in in islamabad, the capital, promoting it with the hashtag pashtunlongmarch. as of tuesday, the demonstration s sixth day, at least 5,000 pashtuns from the tribal areas and other parts of the country had joined, and members of all major pakistani political parties had declared their support. certainly, this kind of organized struggle for pashtun rights, reforms and resources has not been seen in years and years, said rahimullah yusufzai, the peshawar based editor of the news, a pakistani newspaper. the people of the tribal areas have had pent up feelings of resentment and anger at their treatment by the state for decades, he added. naqeebullah s killing was just the tipping point. other officials were also quick to assure the demonstrators that they had been heard. tariq fazal chaudhry, a government minister who met with protest leaders, said the government fully supported their demands. but he declined to say when they would be met. \n",

      "philippine police opened fire as a protest by thousands of rice farmers who lost their crops turned violent yesterday, killing one and wounding about a dozen, a leader of a farming group said. about 6,000 farmers blocked a portion of the main highway in north cotabato province on the southern island of mindanao, demanding government assistance after drought linked by some to el nino hit hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland. a farmer died on the spot and about a dozen others were wounded in the legs and shoulders, capuyan said, adding the police first tried to disperse them with water cannon but started shooting when they held their ground. north cotabato governor emmylou mendoza said about 20 police were wounded when the farmers attacked them with sticks and stones. she said the first shot was fired by the protesters. any violation of national police rules and regulations shall be meted out with the appropriate penalty, national police spokesman chief superintendent wilben mayor said in a statement. the protest began on wednesday when farmers barricaded the highway in kidapawan, demanding a dialogue with the governor and the release of 15,000 sacks of rice she had promised to them as relief. in koronadal, at least 2,000 farmers pushed back some 30 antiriot policemen who tried to disperse their rally. the law enforcers had to retreat to the department of agriculture office da there. the farmers padlocked the front doors of the da building. the trapped policemen had to get out through the backdoor. ryan lariba, a leader of the bagong alyansang makabayan, which is supporting the farmers, said the 2,000 farmers gathered at the da office to condemn what they said was the government s failure to address the plight of farmers stricken by the drought and its failure to provide immediate aid. anti riot policemen, though outnumbered, tried to push the protesters back and used truncheons but the farmers stood their ground and were able to overpower the law enforcers. a similar protest was held by farmers in malaybalay city in bukidnon. at least 100 protesters have also been picketing the da s regional office in davao city since wednesday. domingo azures, regional chairman of the party list group anakpawis, said the protest action in koronadal would be peaceful unlike the one in kidapawan city, where two protesters and a bystander were killed when police opened fire on a farmers barricade to clear a road being blocked by the protesters. the rally in malaybalay ended peacefully on friday after the governor vowed to help the farmers. jun benemerito, secretary general of the kilusang magbubukid ng pilipinas bukidnon, said at least 4,000 farmers from different towns in the province gathered last week in malaybalay city to demand aid. in koronadal city, azures said farmers would continue the protest action until today. south cotabato governor daisy avance fuentes appealed to the protesters to keep calm. she said, however, that 90 per cent of the protesters are not from south cotabato . fuentes said rice would be distributed to farmers starting today. in davao city, at least 100 protesters gathered outside the da regional office. on thursday, at least 500 farmers staged a rally outside the municipal hall of alabel in sarangani. \n",

      "thousands of indonesian taxi and motorised rickshaw drivers staged a violent protest yesterday against uber and other ride hailing services, blocking major roads in the capital, clashing with drivers from app based rivals and setting tyres alight. the protesters adorned their vehicles with signs saying stop illegal taxis and staged a noisy rally in front of parliament, in an upsurge of anger at ride hailing apps after weeks of simmering tensions. as convoys of vehicles brought downtown jakarta to a standstill, the protest turned violent, with taxi drivers jumping up and down on vehicles that refused to take part, drivers working for app based services coming under attack, and some fighting back by hurling rocks. the demonstration came after weeks of rising tensions between traditional public transport operators in the sprawling, traffic clogged metropolis of 10 million and a flurry of new ride hailing services. traditional taxi, motorbike taxi and other public transport drivers are angry that the new services are offering rides at lower prices, claiming they are not paying taxes, and are operating without official permits. jakarta police estimated that up to 6,000 drivers were involved in yesterday s protest, and 6,000 police were out on the streets for the protest. police officials vowed to take action against protesters who committed violence, but it was unclear if they had made any arrests. two days after the rally, a minister said that taxi hailing apps grab and uber technologies must partner with transport businesses and register their cars by the end of may if they want to operate in indonesia. \n",
